            <h2>What Is Mutual Fund?</h2>
            <p class="lead">A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds are a popular way for individuals to invest in a diversified portfolio with associated securities.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="section-title">Here are some key features and characteristics of mutual funds:</h3>

              <h4>Diversification</h4>
              <p>Mutual funds invest in a variety of securities, providing diversification. When you invest in a mutual fund, your money is combined with that of other investors, and the fund manager uses these pooled resources to buy a wide variety of assets. This diversification helps spread risk because your investment is not tied to the performance of a single security or a few securities.</p>

              <h4>Professional Management</h4>
