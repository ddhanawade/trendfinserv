          <h2>What Is Insurance?</h2>
          <p>Insurance is a contractual arrangement between an individual (or entity) and an insurance company, where the individual, known as the policyholder, pays a regular premium in exchange for financial protection and coverage against specified risks. The insurance company provides a safety net to help individuals or businesses manage and mitigate the financial consequences of unexpected or adverse events.</p>

          <h3>Here are some key aspects of insurance:</h3>

          <p><strong>Policy:</strong> An insurance policy is a legal contract that outlines the terms and conditions of coverage. It specifies the types of risks or events that are covered, the premium amount, the coverage limits, and any exclusions or conditions.</p>

          <p><strong>Premium:</strong> The policyholder pays regular premiums to the insurance company. Premiums can be paid monthly, quarterly, annually, or according to the terms of the policy. The cost of the premium is typically based on the level of coverage, the type of insurance, and the insured risk.</p>

          <p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Insurance provides coverage against specific risks or events that may occur, depending on the type of insurance policy. Common types of insurance include health insurance, life insurance, auto insurance, homeowners or renters insurance, and business insurance, among others.</p>

          <p><strong>Claims:</strong> The insurance company is the entity that underwrites and sells insurance policies. It is responsible for paying claims to policyholders when covered events occur.</p>

          <p><strong>Policyholder:</strong> The individual or entity that purchases an insurance policy is the policyholder. They are entitled to receive the benefits and coverage specified in the policy when a covered event occurs.</p>

          <p><strong>Claim:</strong> When a covered event occurs, the policyholder can file a claim with the insurance company to receive the financial benefits or compensation as outlined in the policy.</p>

          <p><strong>Coverage Limits:</strong> Insurance policies often have coverage limits, which represent the maximum amount the insurer will pay for a covered event. Policyholders may need to be aware of these limits when selecting their coverage.</p>
